<h2>Objects</h2>
Object are the basic run-time entities in an object oriented system. They may represent a person,a place,a bank account or any item that the program has to handle. Objects takeup space in the memory.<br>
When a program is executed the objects interact by sending messages to one another.<br>
for eg. if "costomer" and "Account" are two objects a message to the account object requesting for the bank balance.<br>
object can interact without having to know details of each other's data or code<br>
