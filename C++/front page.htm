<h3>Introduction:-</h3>
The prime purpose of C++ programming was to add object orientation to the C programming language, which is in  one of the most powerful programming languages.

The core of the pure object-oriented programming is to create an object, in code, that has certain properties and methods. While designing C++ modules, we try to see whole world in the form of objects. For example a car is an object which has certain properties such as color, number of doors, and the like. It also has certain methods such as accelerate, brake, and so on.
